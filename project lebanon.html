<br><h1 style="font-size:170%;"> <u>Some of Lebanon disastrous events:</u></h1>

<ul>
  <li><b><u>17 October Revolution:</u></b>. <p>Two years ago,on Oct.17 2019,the people took to the streets across Lebanon with an unprecedented sense of unity,<br>calling for the downfall of the entire political
  and economic power structure that has been governing the country since the end of the armed conflict in 1990.<br>
  During the protests,people on the streets stood in front of TV cameras and made their demands heard.<br><br></p>

  <p>In October 2019, the people took to the streets after a series of calamitous economic shocks:
  <ol>  
  <li>Private banks stopped allowing customers access to their dollar-denominated savings and current accounts.</li> 
  <li>The Lebanese currency lost its engineered stability for the first time in 30 years.</li> 
  <li>The unemployment, inflation and poverty rates</ol></p></li>

  <li><b><u>August 4:</b></u><br>
  <p><b>As the country mourns more than 220 blast victims, rights groups decry lack of accountability among political leaders.</b><br>
  <b>Three years after hundreds of people were killed</b> in the port blast that devastated Beirut, religious leaders and rights groups decried the lack of accountability among political leaders who stymied the official investigation.<br>
  <b>Three years on</b>,the probe is virtually at a standstill, leaving survivors still yearning for answers.</br>
  Authorities at the time said the disaster was triggered by a fire in a warehouse where a vast stockpile of industrial chemical ammonium nitrate had been haphazardly <b>stored for years.</b></p></li><br><br>
