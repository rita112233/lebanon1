<p style="font-size:125%; "style="font-family:verdana;">Lebanon is definitely one of the world’s most historical places, as its history predates written records. The area that became Lebanon was occupied by the Phoenicians between 300 and 800 BCE<br>, and this trend of occupation continued for centuries, 
which makes for a fascinating visual history. <br>Recent archaeological finds show that Lebanon still has many historical treasures to be discovered.<br>
Some places worth seeing are the Roman Ruins in Baalbek and Old Souks in Jbeil.<br>
